      <h2>Machine learning</h2>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="machinelpic.PNG" style="width:350px;height:200px;"></div>
      <p>Machine learning is a powerful subfield of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. With machine learning, computers can recognize patterns and make predictions based on past experiences, making them incredibly useful for a wide range of applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and anomaly detection. As the amount of data in the world continues to grow, machine learning will become increasingly important in helping us make sense of it all.</p>
